 ⚽ Dinamo Notebook

Dinamo Notebook is an open-source browser extension for football video analysis and tactical drawing.

It’s built for people who *think* about the game — analysts, coaches, developers, and fans who want better tools to break football down, frame by frame.

Created by Sergei Arlov at Dinamo 1945 Pančevo (Serbia).

 🎯 Mission

Football analysis shouldn’t be locked behind expensive platforms or closed ecosystems.

Dinamo Notebook exists to bring together:
- developers who can build,
- analysts who can read the game,
- coaches who can teach,
- and fans who simply care deeply about football.

The goal is simple:  
give the football community a powerful, transparent, local-first tool for understanding the game better — and let the community shape where it goes next.
