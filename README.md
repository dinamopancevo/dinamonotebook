Dinamo Notebook is an open-source browser extension for football video analysis and tactical drawing.

It’s built for people who *think* about the game — analysts, coaches, developers, and fans who want better tools to break football down, frame by frame.

Created by Sergei Arlov at Dinamo 1945 Pančevo (Serbia).

Football analysis shouldn’t be locked behind expensive platforms or closed ecosystems.

Dinamo Notebook exists to bring together:
- developers who can build,
- analysts who can read the game,
- coaches who can teach,
- and fans who simply care deeply about football.

The goal is simple:  
give the football community a powerful, transparent, local-first tool for understanding the game better — and let the community shape where it goes next.

---

- 100% free — no subscriptions, no paid tiers  
- MIT licensed — free to use, modify, and build upon  
- Open source — all code is public and auditable  
- Local-first — everything runs in your browser  
- No servers, no tracking, no analytics, no accounts

AI features are optional and require your own OpenAI API key.  
We don’t sell keys, proxy requests, or mark up usage.

All analysis data stays on your machine.

Dinamo Notebook works directly on:
- YouTube (`youtube.com`, `youtu.be`)
- Dailymotion
- Twitch (live streams and VODs)

No downloads. No re-uploads.  
Analyze the video where it already lives.

AI-Assisted Analysis (Optional)

Requires your own OpenAI API key.

Use AI as an assistant — not a black box:
- Tactical explanations of formations and structures  
- Player movement and positioning analysis  
- Defensive and attacking pattern breakdowns  
- Situation-specific questions (e.g. *“What’s wrong with this press?”*)  
- Coaching suggestions and tactical alternatives  

You decide what to ask and when to use it.

Why This Exists

Most football analysis tools are:
- expensive  
- closed  
- cloud-locked  
- built without developer transparency  

Dinamo Notebook is an alternative:
- open  
- local  
- hackable  
- built with the community, not above it
